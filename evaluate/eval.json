This means that there is no more mineralization and respiration, and plants (debatebly also a ‘soil organism’) would not be able to take up nutrients because also biochemical weathering of parent material would stop (also done by soil organisms). In short, also all plants would die and all soil-related C would stay in the soil. Photosynthesis will also come to a halt and soil C cycling would be totally obstructed (no more C fluxes between the soil and the atmosphere or the soil-related biosphere). There would be no more food production, or other soil ecosystem services, possible. The oceans would need to take over all C cycling with the atmosphere. Of course this is a totally drastic situation, but it illustrates how important and crucial the soil is.",

            "Bioturbation is the process by which soil animals mix organic matter into the soil, and homogenize the soil horizons of the top soil. Soil structure is improved by bioturbation. By creating biopores and by mixing organic matter into the soil, soil animals contribute to a PHCP of the soil (permanently heterogeneous connected pore system). This heterogeneous pore system is made up of pores with variable sizes and is essential for plant roots and thus plant growth.

Very poor parent materials (coarse texture and poor mineralogy) support plants and trees that produce low-quality litter that is mainly decomposed by fungi. Fungi produce organic acids that form complexes with organic polymers and Fe and Al. These complexes (chelates) move down the soil profile with percolating rainwater.

Soil animals also mix the soil and change soil structural elements by digging, eating and excreting. Flat-faced prisms and angular blocky soil structure types will become more rounded and columnar and subangular blocky structures will form.",
            "Acid sulfate soils form especially in coastal plains because marine sediments will contain sulfate (SO42-), which is needed to form H2S. Reduced iron reacts with H2S to form pyrite (FeS2). If FeS2 oxidizes when oxygen enters the soil during biological and physical ripening processes, sulfuric acid is produced. Soils where these processes occur are called acid sulfate soils.",

Indirect effects of human activities on soil formation are effects that can extend far beyond where people live. For example, by polluting the air all sorts of polluting substances enter soil systems far from where the pollutants were produced (cities and industrial areas). Air pollutants can be fine dust, emissions of greenhouse gases and the formation of sulfur dioxide. Consequences are acid rain and environmental effects that can be linked to global climate change.",
